# Swift-Algorithm-Questions
##Daily Algorithm & Data Structure Practice  
######Each day to get better at algorithms & data structures I try to tackle one or two problems. After solving the problem I push my code up, to try and help others who are struggling with algorithm and data structure problems. Some problems are very simple and some are very tricky depending on a persons skill level in swift. I am no expert and there maybe other ways to solve the same problem more efficienty. Hope you enjoy!!!:-)
